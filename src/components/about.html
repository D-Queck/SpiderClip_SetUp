        <div class="spacer-sm"></div>
        <p>
          SpiderClip was co-developed by the Serious Games Engineering research group at University of Kaiserslautern-Landau. 
          This open-source framework for VR wearables has underpinned a variety of HCI and exergame studies—from 
          real-time sensor integration to extensive usability evaluations in virtual reality fitness environments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Its modular architecture enables researchers and developers to rapidly prototype new devices,
          capture raw data in real time, and seamlessly integrate with leading VR tracking systems.
